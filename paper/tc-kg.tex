\begin{abstract}
  We first present a formal view of a knowledge graph. On this basis,
  the type-checking rules are developed to define correct typing
  relationships among the triples of a knowledge graph. We discuss the
  algorithms for verifying the typing relationships against the given
  knowledge graph. Finally, we present the experimental results of
  type-checking the Yago4 knowledge graph.

\section{Definition of knowledge graph}

This section defines a knowledge graph as a RDF graph \cite{rdf} using
RDF-Schema \cite{rdfschema} for the representation of the structural
part of a knowledge base.

Let $I$ be the set of URI-s, $B$ be the set of blanks and $L$ be the
set of literals. Let us also define sets $S = I\cup\/B$, $P = I$, and
$O = I\cup\/B\cup\/L$.

Let $I$ be the set of URI-s, $B$ the set of blanks and $L$ be the set
of literals. Let us also define sets $S = I\cup\/B$, $P = I$, and
$O = I\cup\/B\cup\/L$.

\emph{RDF triple} is a triple $(s,p,o)\in\/S\times\/P\times\/O$.
\emph{RDF graph} $g\subseteq\/S\times\/P\times\/O$ is a set of
triples. Set of all graphs will be denoted as $G$. We suppose the
existence of a set of variables $V$ and the set of \emph{terms}
$T = O\cup\/V$. Term $t\in\/T$ is ground if $t\in\/O$.

We say that RDF graph $g_1$ is \emph{sub-graph} of $g_2$, denoted
$g_1 \sqsubseteq g_2$, if all triples in $g_1$ are also triples from
$g_2$. 

\notes{Define major structure of KG on the basis of the sorts of data.}
\notes{...the set $I$ includes individual identifiers $I_i$, class identifiers $I_c$ and predicate identifiers $I_p$.}










\section{Type system used}

\subsection{Product types}

\subsection{Intersection type}

The instances of the intersection type $T_1\land\/T_2$ are objects
belonging to both $T_1$ and $T_2$. The type $T_1\land\/T_2$ is the
greatest lower bound of the types $T_1$ and $T_2$. In general,
$\land[T_1\ldots\/T_n]$ is the greatest lower bound of types
$T_1\ldots\/T_n$ \cite{Pierce91IntersectUnion,Pierce96IntersectionTypes}.

\begin{equation}
T_1\land\/T_2\preceq\/T_1    
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_1\land\/T_2\preceq\/T_2  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\land[T_1\ldots\/T_n] \preceq\/T_i  
\end{equation}

If the type $S$ is more specific than the types $T_1\ldots\/T_n$ then
$S$ is more specific then $\land[T_1\ldots\/T_n]$. First, we present
the rule for a pair of types $T_1$ and $T_2$.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{S\preceq\/T_1\quad\/S\preceq\/\/T_2}
      {S\preceq\/T_1\land\/T_2}  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:intsc-gather}
\dfrac{\text{forall i,\ } S\preceq\/T_i}
      {S\preceq\land[T_1\ldots\/T_n]}  
\end{equation}

\subsection{Union type}

The intersection and union types are dual. This can be seen also from
the rules that are used for each particular type.

The instances from the union type $T_1\lor\/T_2$ are either the
instances of $T_1$ or $T_2$, or the instances of both types. The type
$T_1\lor\/T_2$ is the smallest upper bound of the types $T_1$ and
$T_2$. In general, $\lor[T_1\ldots\/T_n]$ is the smallest upper bound
of types $T_1\ldots\/T_n$ \cite{Pierce90CalculusIntersectUnion}.

\begin{equation}
T_1\preceq\/T_1\lor\/T_2    
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_2\preceq\/T_1\lor\/T_2  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_i\preceq\/\lor[T_1\ldots\/T_n]  
\end{equation}

If the type $T$ is more general than the types $S_1\ldots\/S_n$ then
$T$ is more general then $\lor[S_1\ldots\/S_n]$. First, we present
the rule for types $T_1$ and $T_2$.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{S_1\preceq\/T\quad\/S_2\preceq\/\/T}
      {S_1\lor\/S_2\preceq\/T}  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\text{forall i,\ } S_i\preceq\/T}
      {\lor[S_1\ldots\/S_n]\preceq\/T}  
\end{equation}

\subsection{Typing literals}

\notes{Literals are identifiers of atomic type!}





\subsection{Stored typing and subtyping of identifiers.}\nl

The individual and class entities are represented by identifiers from
the set $\I$. The individual identifiers $\Ii$ stand for literals,
concrete and abstract entities. The class identifiers $\Ic$ represent
abstract entities that have an unempty interpretation. The abstract
entities include, besides the identifiers of user-defined classes,
the types (classes) of literals.

A graph database includes stored definitions for typing the individual
identifiers, and for representing the specialization/generalization
hierarchies of classes and properties.

Let us introduce the typing and specialization/generalization
relationships formally. The expression $i:_\darr\/C$ states that a
class $C$ is a type of an individual identifier $i$. The expression
$i_1\preceq_\darr\/i_2$ defines the sub-class relationship between the
class identifiers $i_1$ and $i_2$. The index '$\darr$' in relations
$:_\darr$ and $\preceq_\darr$ denotes that the relationships is stored
in a database. Such notation allows us to address differently the
stored and the derived parts of the graph database schema.

%\notes{Partial ordering defined with stored schema triples in a database.}
%\notes{The relationships that poset $\preceq_1$ covers are rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf. }
%\notes{Identifiers included in $:_1$ are between ground idents and base classes.}
%\notes{This allows us to separate and also address separately the ssg and subtyping relationship.}

\memo{Oportunity to introduce ``mixed'' objects including ground and schema components.}

The rule for the one-step relationship $:_\darr$ is defined using the
predicate rdf:type.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I\in\Ii\quad I_c\in\Ic\quad (I,\text{rdf:type},I_c)\in \D}
      {I :_\darr I_c}
\end{equation}

The individual entity $I$ can have more than one stored types, e.g.,
$I_{c1}$ and $I_{c2}$. Therefore, $I:_\darr\/I_{c1}$ and
$I:_\darr\/I_{c2}$ holds, and we can instead write
$I:_\darr\/I_{c1}\land\/I_{c2}$. All existing stored typings of $I$
can be gathered by Rule \ref{rul:3-ground-gather} presented later.

A one-step subtyping relationship $\preceq_\darr$ is defined by means
of the RDF predicate rdfs:sub\-ClassOf in the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\Ic \quad (I_1,\text{rdfs:subClassOf},I_2)\in \D}
{I_1 \preceq_\darr\/I_2}
\end{equation}

The rule for the definition of the one-step subtyping relationship
$\preceq_\darr$ is based on the predicate rdfs:subPropertyOf.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\Ip \quad (I_1,\text{rdfs:subPropertyOf},I_2)\in \D}
      {I_1\preceq_\darr\/I_2}
\end{equation}




\subsection{Typing and subtyping identifiers.}\nl

The one-step relationships $:_\darr$ and $\preceq_\darr$ are now
extended with the reflexivity and transitivity to obtain the
relationships $:$ and $\preceq$. The relation $\preceq$ forms a
partial ordering of class
identifiers. %Further, the subtyping relation $\preceq$ is used to
%extend typing relation $:$ with the rule of \emph{subsumption}.

First, the one-step relationship $\preceq_s$ is generalized to the
relationship $\preceq$ defined over class identifiers $\Ic$.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-extended}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\Ic \quad I_1\preceq_\darr I_2}
      {I_1 \preceq I_2}
\end{equation}

Next, the subtyping relationship $\preceq$ is reflexive.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-reflexivity}
\dfrac{S\in \Ic}
      {S\preceq\/S}
\end{equation}

The subtype relationship is also transitive. 

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-transitivity}
\dfrac{S,U,T\in\Ic \quad S\preceq\/U \quad U\preceq\/T}
      {S\preceq\/T}   
\end{equation}

Finally, the subtype relationship is asymmetric which is expressed
using the following rule. 

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-antisymmetry}
\dfrac{S,U\in\Ic \quad S\preceq\/U \quad U\preceq\/S}
      {S=T}   
\end{equation}

As a consequence of the rules
\ref{rul:Ic-reflexivity}-\ref{rul:Ic-antisymmetry} the relation
$\preceq$ is a poset.

Knowledge graphs include a special class $\top$ that represents the
root class of the ontology. In RDF ontologies $\top$ is usually
represented by the predicate owl:Thing. The following rule specifys
that all class identifiers are more specific than $\top$.

\begin{equation}
S\preceq\top
\end{equation}

%\subsection{Typing of identifiers.}
The stored typing relation $:_s$ is now extended to the typing
relation $:$ that takes into account the subtyping relation $\preceq$.
The following rule states that a stored type is a type.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I\in\Ii \quad C\in\Ic \quad I:_s\/C}
      {I:C}
\end{equation}

The link between the typing relation and subtype relation is provided
by adding a typing rule called \emph{rule of subsumption}
\cite{Pierce02TypesProgLang}.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I\in\Ii \quad I:S \quad S\preceq\/T}
      {I:T}    
\end{equation}

\subsection{Deriving a ground type of a triple.}

\noindent
A ground type of an individual identifier $i$ is a class $C$ related
to $i$ by one-step type relationship $:_\darr$ denoting a ground
type. In terms of the concepts of a knowledge graph, $C$ and $i$ are
related by the relationship rdf:type.

A ground type of a triple $t=(s,p,o)$ is a triple $T=T_s*p*T_o$ that
includes the ground types of $t$'s components $s$ and $o$, and the
property $p$ which now has the role of a type. A ground type of a
triple is defined by the following rule.

\begin{equation}
  \label{rul:3-ground}
\dfrac{t\in\/\Ti,\ t=(s,p,o)\quad I_s,I_o\in\Ic\quad s:_\darr\/I_s\quad p:_\darr\text{owl:ObjectProperty}\quad o:_\darr\/I_o}
      {t:_\darr\/I_s*p*I_o}
\end{equation}

The class $I_s$ is one of the ground types of $s$, and the type $I_o$
is one of the ground types of $o$. The predicates are treated
differently to the subject and object components of triples. The
predicates have the role of classes while they are instances of
owl:ObjectProperty.

There can be multiple ground types of a triple. They may be gathered
into a single $\land$-type by using the following rule. The types
$T_1$,\ldots,$T_n$ are obtained using Rule~\ref{rul:3-ground}.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-ground-gather}
\dfrac{t\in \Ti\quad \forall i\in[1,n], T_i\in\Tt\quad t:_\darr\/T_i}
      {t:_\darr\land[T_i]}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Deriving a lub type of a triple}

\notes{Typing using lub types of $T_1..T_n$. Explain why this is needed?}

Let us now define the least upper bound types (abbr. \emph{lub}) of
ground types derived by Rule \ref{rul:3-ground-gather}. Since a
partialy ordered set is not a lattice, we can have more than one lub
type for a given set of ground types.

The lub types of a given list of triple types $T_1..T_n$ are
computed in two steps as before when gathering multiple ground types
with conjunction. A single lub type is defined as follows.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t:_\darr\land[T_1..T_n]\quad T,S\in\Tt\quad \forall\/i,\ T_i\preceq\/T\quad \forall\/j, T_j\preceq\/S\quad T\preceq\/S}
      {\vdash\/t:_\sqcup\/T}
\end{equation}

The above rule states that a lub type $T$ is a ground type
$\land[T_1..T_n]$ if all ground types $T_i$ are subtypes of
$T$. Furthermore, the lub type $T$ is the least (closest) supertype of
all members of ground $\land$-type $T_1,\ldots\/,T_n$. The lub types
can be now gathered using the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\forall i, T_i\in\Tt\quad t:_\sqcup\/T_i}
      {t:_\sqcup\land[T_1..T_n]}
\end{equation}


\memo{The types of $s$ and $o$ can be any classes $T_s$ and $T_o$ from
  ${\cal I}_c$, while the type of $p$ has to be a class $T_p$ that is
  a subclass of rdf:Property. The typing of a triple $t$ is correct
  since the interpretation of $T$ includes $t$.}

\memo{Moreover, the types $T$ that are derived by the above rule are
  minimal in the sense that given the information provided, i.e., the
  types of $t$'s components, their interpretations are minimal
  possible comparing them to the interpretations of all other derived
  types of $t$.}






\subsection{Stored types of triples.}\nl

\notes{Make a bit more clear picture of the GLB triple types selected as the final stored type of a triple.}
\notes{Analysis tool. Show minimality of the stored types (either enumerated or gathered with $\bigvee$).}
\notes{\emph{Reminder:} when a complete stored (user-defined) type is related to the base type of a triple, some of GLB types may be eliminated.}

We first find a stored schema triples for a given triple $t=(s,p,o)$. A
stored schema triple is constructed by selecting types including a
predicate that has the domain and range defined.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-stored}
\dfrac{t\in\Ti,t=(s,p,o)\quad p\preceq\/p'\quad (p',\text{domain},T_u)\in\/g\quad (p',\text{range},T_o)\in\/g}
      {t:_u(T_u,p,T_o)}
\end{equation}


\medskip
%\notes{Generator view of rules: Just describe the properties of pre-conditions and conclusions for a particular lub type of triple.}
\notes{Comments and description of the above rule.}

The domain and range of a predicate $p$ can be defined for any
super-predicate, they do not need to be defined for $p$. In addition,
the domain and range of a predicates do not need to be defined for the
same predicate; they can be defined for any of the super-predicates
separately. The following rule captures also the last statement.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-stored1}
\dfrac{t\in\Ti, t=(s,p,o)\quad p\preceq\/p_1\quad p\preceq\/p_2\quad (p_1,\text{domain},T_u)\in\/g
                \quad (p_2,\text{range},T_o)\in\/g}
      {t:_u(T_s,p,T_o)}
\end{equation}

\notes{If $p$ inherits from multiple $p'\succeq\/p$, then the above rule generates multiple types. Explain.}

Note that the type is determined only in the case that the domain and
range of $p$ or some $p'\succeq\/p$ is defined. Otherwise, the domain
and range shoud be $\top$.

The following rule is a judgment for a (user-defined) type of a
concrete triple $t=(s,p,o)$. A user-defined type of $t$ is the
greatest lower bound of stored types generated by the rule
\ref{rul:3-stored}.

\notes{A general explanation for choosing glb type should be given. Further expanded below. (?)}
\notes{Explanation: Choosing the smallest types to have the smallest interpretations.}
\notes{Explaination: Smallest search space for queries.} 

\notes{The meaning of $\not\sim$ is \emph{not related}.}
\notes{This can be either is if we have two $p$ roots with unrelated glb schema triples (trees up).}
\notes{Or, two $p$-rooted but unrelated stored types through multiple inheritance.}
\notes{Therefore, we can have more than one glb stored types.}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t\in\Ti\quad t:_u\/T\quad \forall(t:_u\/S), T\preceq\/S\lor\/T\not\sim\/S}
      {t:_{glb}\/T}
\end{equation}

The first premise says that $t$ is an individual triple. The second
premise determines one of the stored types $T$ of $t$. The third
premise requires that type $T$ is the least general type of a
(reverse) tree above the property $p$. Note that there may be more
than one tree rooted in unrelated stored types above $p$.

The implementation view of the above rule is as follows. The schema
triples are obtained from the inherited values of the predicates
rdfs:domain and rdfs:range. The inherited values have to be the
closest when traveling from property $p$ towards the more general
properties.

\medskip
\notes{Why do we have multixsple glb types? Add explanation.}
\notes{(The following paragraph is not completed! More precise!)}

Multiple different schema triples for a given $t$ are possible only in
the case of multiple inheritance, in the case of the definition of the
disjunctive domain/range types, or if predicate is defined for
semantically different concepts. (describe each possibility in more
detail.)

\notes{Add explanation about why glb types are connected with $\lor$.}
\notes{$\lor$ is used since they represent alternative semantics of a triple.}
\notes{When type-checking a language, a context can be used to resolve disjunctions.}

Now we can put together the greatest lower bounds of the top types by
making the union of the glb types computed by the previous rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t\in\Ti\quad \forall\/i\in[1..n], t:_{glb}\/T_i}
      {t:_u\bigvee\/T_i}
\end{equation}

\notes{Expand on the influence/effect of using $\bigvee$ type in context and in other rules.}






\subsection{Typing a triple.}\nl

\notes{Two ways of defining semantics.}
\notes{1) enumeration style: stored types are enumerated as alternatives ($\lor$).}
\notes{2) packed together: alternative types are packed in one $\bigvee$ type.}
\notes{One advantage of (1) is that individual glb types can be processed further individually.}
\notes{Advantage of (2) is the higer-level semantics without going in implementation.}

\notes{Now stored types have to be related to all lub base types to represent the correct type of a triple.}
\notes{It seems it would be easier to check the pairs one-by-one using (1) in algorithms.}
\notes{In case of using complete types in the phases, types would further have to be processed by $\land,\lor$ rules.}

The type of a triple $t=(s,p,o)$ is computed by first deriving the
base type $T$ and the top type $S$ of $t$. Then, we check if $S$ is
reachable from $T$ through the sub-class and sub-property hierarchies,
i.e., $T\preceq\/S$.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{(s,p,o):_1T\quad (s,p,o):_2S\quad (T\preceq\/S)}
      {(s,p,o):S}
\end{equation}
