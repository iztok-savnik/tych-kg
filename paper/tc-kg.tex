\section{Preliminaries}


\subsection{Knowledge graph\label{sec:kg}}

This section defines a knowledge graph as a RDF graph \cite{rdf} using
RDF-Schema \cite{rdfschema} for the representation of the structural
part of a knowledge base. 

Let $I$ be the set of URI-s, $B$ be the set of blanks and $L$ be the
set of literals. Let us also define sets $S = I\cup\/B$, $P = I$, and
$O = I\cup\/B\cup\/L$. A \emph{RDF triple} is a triple
$(s,p,o)\in\/S\times\/P\times\/O$. A \emph{RDF graph}
$g\subseteq\/S\times\/P\times\/O$ is a set of triples. Set of all
graphs will be denoted as $G$.

%We say that RDF graph $g_1$ is \emph{sub-graph} of $g_2$, denoted
%$g_1 \sqsubseteq g_2$, if all triples in $g_1$ are also triples from
%$g_2$. 

To abstract away the details of the RDF data model we unify the
representation of knowledge graph by separating solely between the
identifiers and triples. In view of the above formal representation of
RDF triples, the complete set of identifiers is
$\I=I\cup\/B\cup\/L$. The identifiers from $\I$ are classified into
the sets including literals $\I_l$, individual (ground) identifiers
$\I_i$, class identifiers $\I_c$, predicate identifiers $\I_p$.

The complete set of triples, referred to as $\T$, is classified into
the sets of individual (ground) triples $\T_i$, triple types $\T_t$
and abstract triples $\T_a$. The individual triples include solely the
individual identifiers $\I_i$ and predicates $\I_p$. The triple types
include only class identifiers $\I_c$ and predicates. Finally, the
abstract triples link individual and class identifiers in single
triples.



\subsection{Typing rule language}

In this paper we define typing of a data language used to represent a
TBOX \cite{Brachman2004KnowledgeRR} of a knowledge base given in a
form of a knowledge graph. The data language specifys the assertions
in the form of triples and the schema of assertions as the types of
triples. The ground triples are the instances of the triple types that
altogether define the schema of a KG.

In comparison to the data structures used in programming languages
\cite{Pierce2002,Hindley1997}, the data language of a KG is more
complex. First, a KG graph includes an ontology of classes and
properties. Second, typing of ground identifiers is stored in a KG,
i.e., each ground identifier has one or more types represented as
class identifiers. Further, the properties (predicates) of a KG are
treated as objects that are included in a classification hierarchy of
properties. For each property we have the definition of one or more
triple types stored in a KG. Finally, the properties (including triple
types) are inherited through the classification hierarchy of classes
and predicates.

Furthermore, the data language of a KG, which is based on RDF and
RDF-Schema \cite{rdf,rdfschema}, does not include variables as in
the case for the expressions of a programming language. All
information needed for typing a ground triple is available from a KG.

For the above presented reasons, we do not use standard typing rule
language \cite{Pierce2002,Hindley1997} that includes the context
$\Gamma$ where the types of the variables are stored. We use more
expressive meta-language that is rooted in first order logic
(abbr. FOL). The rules are composed of a set of premises and a
conclusion. The premises are either typing judgements in the form
$o:T$, or expressions in the FOL. The expressions of FOL can express
complex premises such as the requirements for the LUB and GLB triple
types. The conclusion part of the rule is a typing or subtyping
jufgement.

The rules are grounded in a knowledge graph through the sets of
identifiers and triples that are defined in Section
\ref{sec:kg}. In rules we specify the domain for each symbol used.
When we write $O\in\/S$ then we mean the \emph{existence} of $O$ in a
set $S$. We use universal quantification $\forall\/O\in\/S,\ p(O)$
when we state that some property $p(O)$ holds for all objects $O$ from
$S$.

Similar to \cite{Dunfield2021}, we differ between two interpretations
of rules. First, the \emph{generator} view of rules is the forward
interpretation where rules sythesize the types from the types derived
by premises. The premises of the rule are treated from the left to the
right. The quantification of the symbols binds the symbols up to the
last premise unless defined differently by the parentheses. Second,
the \emph{type-checking} view of the rules is the backward
interpretation. Given the symbol and its type, the construction of a
given type is checked by the rules.




\section{Typing identifiers}

The set of identifiers $\I$ include ground identifiers $\I_g$, class
identifiers $\I_c$, and the predicates (properties) $\I_p$ that are
are both ground identifiers, since they are instances of rdf:Property,
and similar to class identifiers, since they act as types and form an
ontology of predicates.

In this section we present typing of ground identifiers. The types of
ground identifiers are further used for typing ground triples in
Section \ref{sec:triples}. However, before presenting the types of
identifiers, we introduce the intersection and union types that are
used for the description of the types of identifiers in the following
Section \ref{sec:intsc-union}. Typing of literals is described in
Section \ref{sec:literals}. The rules for deriving the stored types of
ground identifiers are given in Section
\ref{sec:idents-stored}. Finally, the sub-typing relation $\preceq$ is
defined for the class identifiers and the complete types of ground
identifiers are presented in Section \ref{sec:idents-typing}.

%\notes{Details.}
%\notes{1. First define base type of identifiers $:_1$ and stored subtyping relationship $\preceq_1$.}
%\notes{2. From the basis define the indent typing $:$ and subtyping rel $\preceq$ among identifiers.}
%\notes{3. Include the link between subtyping and typing.}
%\notes{4. Define lub type using $\land$ type for a given ground ident.}







\subsection{Typing literals\label{sec:literals}}

Literals are the values of an atomic type. The atomic types are in RDF
provided by the RDF-Schema dictionary \cite{rdfschema}. RDF-Schema
defines a list of atomic types, such as xsd:integer, xsd:string, or
xsd:boolean.

Typing of the atomic types is determined by the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{L\in\I_l\quad T\in\I_c,\quad \text{"L"\textasciicircum\textasciicircum\/T}\in\Lt}
      {L:T}  
\end{equation}

The rule states that a literal value $L$ is of a type $T$ if a literal
"L"\textasciicircum\textasciicircum\/T is an element of the set of
literals $\Lt$. A literal "L"\textasciicircum\textasciicircum\/T
includes a literal value $L$ and a literal type $T$ referencing a type
from the RDF-Schema dictionary. As an example, the literal
"365"\textasciicircum\textasciicircum\/xsd:integer includes the
literal value 365 and its type xsd:integer.





\subsection{Stored typing and subtyping of identifiers\label{sec:idents-stored}}

The expression $I:_\darr\/C$ states that a class $C$ is a type of an
individual identifier $I$. The expression $I_1\preceq_\darr\/I_2$
defines the subtype (sub-class) relationship between the class
identifiers $I_1$ and $I_2$. The index '$\darr$' in relations
$:_\darr$ and $\preceq_\darr$ denotes that the relations are stored in
a database---we refere to them as \emph{one-step} typing and subtyping
relations. Such notation allows us to address differently the
\emph{stored} and the \emph{derived} types of the graph database
schema.

%\notes{Partial ordering defined with stored schema triples in a database.}
%\notes{The relationships that poset $\preceq_1$ covers are rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf. }
%\notes{Identifiers included in $:_1$ are between ground idents and base classes.}
%\notes{This allows us to separate and also address separately the ssg and subtyping relationship.}

\memo{Oportunity to introduce ``mixed'' objects including ground and schema components.}

The rule for the one-step typing relation $:_\darr$ is defined using
the predicate rdf:type.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:ident-1step-type}
\dfrac{I\in\Ii\quad I_c\in\Ic\quad (I,\text{rdf:type},I_c)\in \D}
      {I :_\darr I_c}
\end{equation}

The individual entity $I$ can have more than one stored types. By
using a generative interpretation, Rule \ref{rul:ident-1step-type}
synthesizes all types $I_c$ such that $I:I_c$. The rule can be used
either in some other rule that employ it as a generator, or we can
update above rule to generate a $\land$ type including all the types
of $I$ as presented in Section \ref{sec:intsc-union}.

A one-step subtyping relationship $\preceq_\darr$ is defined by means
of the RDF predicate rdfs:sub\-ClassOf in the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\Ic \quad (I_1,\text{rdfs:subClassOf},I_2)\in \D}
{I_1 \preceq_\darr\/I_2}
\end{equation}

The rule for the definition of the one-step subtyping relationship
$\preceq_\darr$ is based on the predicate rdfs:subPropertyOf.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\Ip \quad (I_1,\text{rdfs:subPropertyOf},I_2)\in \D}
      {I_1\preceq_\darr\/I_2}
\end{equation}





\subsection{Typing and subtyping identifiers\label{sec:idents-typing}}

The one-step relationship $\preceq_\darr$ is now extended with the
reflectivity, transitivity and asymmetry to obtain the relationship
$\preceq$. Relation $\preceq$ forms a partial ordering of class
identifiers. The ground typing relation $:_\darr$ is then extended
with the \emph{rule of subsumption}, presented as Rule
\ref{rul:typing-subsumption}, to obtain a typing relation $:$.

First, the one-step relationship $\preceq_\darr$ is generalized to the
relationship $\preceq$ defined over class identifiers $\I_c$.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-extended}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\I_c \quad I_1\preceq_\darr I_2}
      {I_1 \preceq I_2}
\end{equation}

Next, the subtyping relationship $\preceq$ is reflexive.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-reflexivity}
\dfrac{I_c\in \I_c}
      {I_c\preceq\/I_c}
\end{equation}

The subtype relationship is also transitive. 

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-transitivity}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2,I_3\in\I_c \quad I_1\preceq\/I_2 \quad I_2\preceq\/I_3}
      {I_1\preceq\/I_3}   
\end{equation}

Finally, the subtype relationship is asymmetric which is expressed
using the following rule. 

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:Ic-antisymmetry}
\dfrac{I_1,I_2\in\I_c \quad I_1\preceq\/I_2 \quad I_2\preceq\/I_1}
      {I_1=I_2}   
\end{equation}

As a consequence of the rules
\ref{rul:Ic-reflexivity}-\ref{rul:Ic-antisymmetry} the relation
$\preceq$ is a poset.

Knowledge graphs include a special class $\top$ that represents the
root class of the ontology. In RDF ontologies $\top$ is usually
represented by the predicate owl:Thing \cite{Hoffart2013}. The
following rule specifys that all class identifiers are more specific
than $\top$.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\forall\/S\in\I_c}
      {S\preceq\top}
\end{equation}

%\subsection{Typing of identifiers.}
The stored typing relation $:_\darr$ is now extended to the typing
relation $:$ that takes into account the subtyping relation $\preceq$.
The following rule states that a stored type is a type.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{I\in\I_i \quad C\in\I_c \quad I:_\darr\/C}
      {I:C}
\end{equation}

The link between the typing relation and subtype relation is provided
by adding a typing rule called \emph{rule of subsumption}
\cite{Pierce2002}.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:typing-subsumption}
\dfrac{I\in\I_i\quad S\in\I_c\quad I:S \quad S\preceq\/T}
      {I:T}    
\end{equation}


\memo{Properties have dual role: they are instances and types at the same time.}
\memo{Present the features of properties from this point of view.}






\section{Intersection and union types\label{sec:intsc-union}}

The instances of the intersection type $T_1\land\/T_2$ are objects
belonging to both $T_1$ and $T_2$. The type $T_1\land\/T_2$ is the
greatest lower bound of the types $T_1$ and $T_2$. In general,
$\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ is the greatest lower bound (abbr. GLB) of
types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ \cite{Pierce1991,Pierce1996}. The instances of
the type $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ form a maximal set of objects that
belong to all types $T_i$.

The rules for the $\land$ and $\lor$ types presented in this section
are general---they apply for the identifier types $\I_c$ and triple
types $\T_t$. The set of types $\tau=\I_c\cup\T_t$ is used to ground
the types in the rules.

The instances of a type $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ are the instances of all
particular types $T_i$. This is stated by the following rule. 

\memo{\begin{equation}
\dfrac{T_1,T_2\in\tau}
      {T_1\land\/T_2\preceq\/T_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{T_1,T_2\in\tau}
      {T_1\land\/T_2\preceq\/T_2}
\end{equation}}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\forall\/i\in[1..n],\ T_i\in\tau}
      {\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}] \preceq\/T_i} 
\end{equation}

Further, the following rule states that if the type $S$ is more
specific than the types $T_1,\ldots\/,T_n$ then $S$ is more specific
then $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$.

\memo{\begin{equation}
\dfrac{S,T_1,T_2\in\tau\quad S\preceq\/T_1\quad\/S\preceq\/\/T_2}
      {S\preceq\/T_1\land\/T_2}  
\end{equation}}

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:intsc-gather}
\dfrac{S\in\tau\quad\forall\/i\in[1..n],\ T_i\in\tau\quad\/S\preceq\/T_i}
      {S\preceq\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}  
\end{equation} 

The intersection and union types are dual. This can be seen also from
the duality of the rules for the $\land$ and $\lor$ types.

The instances from the union type $T_1\lor\/T_2$ are either the
instances of $T_1$ or $T_2$, or the instances of both
types. Therefore, $\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ is the least upper bound of
types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ \cite{Pierce1991}.

\memo{\begin{equation}
\dfrac{T_1,T_2\in\tau}
      {T_1\preceq\/T_1\lor\/T_2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{T_1,T_2\in\tau}
      {T_2\preceq\/T_1\lor\/T_2}
\end{equation}}

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:lor-1}
\dfrac{\forall\/i\in[1..n],\ T_i\in\tau}
      {T_i\preceq\/\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
\end{equation}

Finally, if the type $T$ is more general than the types $S_1..\/S_n$
then $T$ is more general then $\lor[S_1..\/S_n]$.

\memo{\begin{equation}
\dfrac{T,S_1,S_2\in\tau\quad S_1\preceq\/T\quad\/S_2\preceq\/\/T}
      {S_1\lor\/S_2\preceq\/T}  
\end{equation}}

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:lor-2}
\dfrac{T\in\tau\quad\forall\/i\in[1..n],\ S_i\in\tau\quad\/S_i\preceq\/T}
      {\lor[S_1..\/S_n]\preceq\/T}  
\end{equation}


\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Semantics of $\land$ and $\lor$ types in KGs.$\ \ $}
The meaning of the $\land$ and $\lor$ types can be defined through
their interpretations. The following definition expresses the
denotation of a $\lor$ type with the interpretations of its component
types. Suppose we have a set of types
$\forall\/i\in\/[1..n],\ T_i\in\tau$.

\begin{displaymath}
  \llbracket\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrbracket_\D = \bigcup_{i\in[1..n]}\llbracket\/T_i\rrbracket_\D
\end{displaymath}

Similarly, the interpretation of a $\land$ type is the intersection of
the interpretations of its component types.

\begin{displaymath}
\llbracket\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrbracket_\D = \bigcap_{i\in[1..n]}\llbracket\/T_i\rrbracket_\D
\end{displaymath}

Note that the interpretation of a class $C$ is a set of instances
$\llbracket\/C\rrbracket_\D=\{I\ |\ I\in\I_i\land\/I:C\}$. Further, the
interpretation of a triple type $T$ is the set of ground triples
$\llbracket\/T\rrbracket_\D=\{t\ |\ t\in\T_t\land\/t:T\}$\footnote{Triple
  types $\T_t$ are presented in the following Section
  \ref{sec:triples}.}\cite{Savnik2025}.\\

\memo{Put together the base types of ground identifiers using $\land$ type.}
\memo{First, the base type of an ground identifier is the $\land$ of all base types.}
\memo{The \emph{base type} of a ground identifier is defined explicitely!}





\subsection{The join and meet types\label{sec:join-meet-types}}

The $\lor$ and $\land$ types are logical types defined through the
sets of instances. Given two types $T$ and $S$ we have a least upper
bound $S\lor\/T$, and a greatest lower bound $S\land\/T$ types where
$S\lor\/T$ denotes a minimal set of objects that are of type $S$
\emph{or} $T$ (or both), and $S\land\/T$ denotes a maximal set of
objects that are of type $S$ \emph{and} $T$, and .

A KG includes a stored poset of classes and triple types that
represent types of the individual objects and ground triples. The
poset can be used to compute a join $S\sqcup\/T$ and a meet
$S\sqcap\/T$. Usual definition of the join and meet operators is by
using a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound if they exist
\cite{Pierce2002}, respectively. However, in a KG we are also
interested in the upper bound and lower bound types
\cite{DaveyPriestley2002}. Let us present an example.

\begin{example}
  Let $P=(U,\preceq)$ be a partialy oredered set $P$ such that
  $U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and the relation
  $\preceq=\{a\preceq\/c,a\preceq\/d,b\preceq\/c,b\preceq\/d,c\preceq\/e,d\preceq\/e\}$.
  The upper bounds of $S=\{a,b\}$ are the elements $c$ and $d$. Since
  there is no lower upper bounds, the upper bounds $\{c,d\}$ are
  minimal upper bounds. The least upper bound of $S$ is $e$.

  In the case that we remove the element $e$ from $P$ then $P$ does
  not have a least upper bound but it still has two minimal upper
  bounds $c$ and $d$. $\finbox$
\end{example}

The least upper bound (abbr. LUB) is by definition one element. It has
to be related to all upper bounds via the relationship $\preceq$.  On
the other hand, the most interesting upper and lower bounds are
minimal upper bounds (abbr. MUB) and maximal lower bounds (abbr. MLB)
\cite{Knudstorp2024}. They are lower than the least upper bound and
higher than the greatest lower bound, respectively. They represent
more detailed information about the parameter set of types $S$ than
the LUB type of $S$.

The join $J=\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ is a set of MUB types
$J_j^{j\in[1,m]}\in\/J$ such that $J_j$ is an upper bound with
$T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\preceq\/J_j$, and there is no such $L$ where
$T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\preceq\/L$ without also having $J_j\preceq\/L$. Since
we have a top type $\top$ defined in a KG, the join of arbitrary two
types always exists.

The meet of types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$, $M=\sqcap[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$, is
a set of the maximal lower bound types $M_j^{j\in[1,m]}\in\/M$ such
that $M_j$ is lower bound with $M_j\preceq\/T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$, and all
other lower bounds $U$ with $U\preceq\/T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ entail
$U\preceq\/M_j$. Note that the meet of the set of types from a KG does
not always exist.

The join type is related to the $\lor$-type. Given a set of types
$\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$, the join $J=\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ is a set
of types $J_j^{j\in[1,m]}\in\/J$ that are the minimal upper bounds
such that $T_i\preceq\/J_j$ for $i\in[1,n]$. On the other hand,
Rule \ref{rul:lor-1} for the $\lor$-types states
$T_i\preceq\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$. However, the join type and
$\lor$-type differ in the interpretation.
$$\llb\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrb_\D=\bigcup_{i\in[1..n]}\llb\/T_i\rrb_\D\subseteq\bigcup_{j\in[1,m]}\llb\/J_j\rrb_\D=\llb\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrb_\D$$

While the interpretation of the type $\lor[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ includes
precisely the instances of all $T_i$, the interpretation of the type
$\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ contains the instances of minimal upper bound
types. The interpretation of $\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ can include
interpretations of classes that are not among $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$.

A meet type of $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ may not exist in a poset of types
from a KG. In general, the meet types $M=\sqcap[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$
exist in a class ontology if the types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ are
\emph{bounded below} which means that there exists a type $L$ such
that $L\preceq\/T_i$ for all $i$. The meet types are not frequent on
the lower levels of a class ontology from a KG.

As in the case of the $\lor$-type and the join type, the semantics of
the $\land$-type is similar to the semantics of the meet type. A
$\land$-type is a type that implements logical view of the greatest
lower bound type. Differently, the meet types are based on the
concrete poset of KG types and represent concrete types though their
interpretation is contained in the interpretation of a
$\land$-type. The type $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ denotes the
intersection $\bigcap\/\llb\/T_i\rrb_\D$ while the interpretation of a
meet type $M_j\in\sqcap[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ includes the interpretation
of the meet types from $M$. Note that the instances of the meet types
are in the intersection of the instances of types
$T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$. The set $\bigcap\/\llb\/T_i\rrb_\D$ can also
include objects that are not instances of any meet type from
$M$. Hence,
$$\llb\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrb_\D=\bigcap_{i\in[1..n]}\/\llb\/T_i\rrb_\D\supseteq\bigcap_{j\in[1,m]}\llb\/M_j\rrb_\D=\llb\sqcap[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrb_\D.$$

In type-checking the ground triples, the join types are used in the
procedure for checking the types derived bottom-up against the stored
schema of a KG as presented in Section \ref{sec:3-ground-types}. The
join as well as meet types are useful in the procedure for
type-checking basic graph patterns \cite{Savnik2025a}. The $\lor$ and
$\land$-types are logical types that can be simplified in the typing
positions of a graph pattern by using typing rules, and can be
approximated by using join and meet types to obtain a more precise
concrete type of a graph pattern variable.




\subsection{Typing with $\land$ and $\lor$ types}

\medskip
\notes{The use of $\land$ and $\lor$ types to describe identifiers.}
\nnotes{$\upsilon=\I_i\cup\T_i$ and $\tau=\I_c\cup\T_t$}
\nnotes{General rules are defined to work with identifiers and triples.}
\nnotes{Hence typing rules can be used to type idents and triples.}

\notes{For $V\in\upsilon$ gather ground types of identifiers with $\land$-type as $V:_{\darr}\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$.}
\nnotes{$V\in\upsilon\quad\forall\/T_i\in\tau,\ t:_{\darr}T_i$.}
\nnotes{The ground type of $V$ is a type $T_g=\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$.}
\ennotes{The following rule geathers all ground types of $V\in\upsilon$.}

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:land-1}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\/T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\in\tau\quad\/V:_{\darr}T_i^{i\in[1,n]}}
      {V:_{\darr}\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
\end{equation}

Let's have a look at $\land$ type composed of $V$'s ground types
$T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ in the case $V\in\I_i$. In Yago \cite{Hoffart2013},
often $V$ has a set of very specific classes $C_s$ but also some
general classes $C_g$. The general classes $C_g$ are close to the
classes used in the stored triple types.  If stored typing of $V$ is
correct, then $C_g$ includes the classes that are supertypes of
classes from $C_s$.

The ground type $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ can include pairs of types
$T_i\preceq\/T_k$ with $i\not=k$. Depending on the further use, we can
either compute the minimal or the maximal elements from the poset
$\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$ with respect to $\preceq$
\cite{DaveyPriestley2002}. The super-types of the minimal elements of
$\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$ include all valid types of $V$. Hence, we use
the set of minimal elements from $\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$ as the starting
point to explore the relations between the ground triple types and the
user-defined triple types of a triple $t$ including $V$ as a
component.

\memo{the type $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ It makes sense
either to compute MIN or MAX of $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ yielding
$\land[S_1..S_m]$ where $m\le\/n$ and
$S_j^{j\in[1,m]}\in\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$. The operator MIN computes
$S_j^{j\in[1,m]}$ such that each $S_j$ is minimal among
$T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$. The operator MAX computes $S_j^{j\in[1,m]}$ such
that each $S_j$ is maximal among $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$. Note that in both
cases there are no pairs among $S_j^{j\in[1,m]}$ related by $\preceq$.}

The operator MIN is defined on a poset of types
$(\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\},\preceq)$. Given a set of types $\{T_i^{i\in[1..n]}\}$
the MIN operator retains types $S_j^{j\in[1,m]}\in\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$
such that ${\nexists}\/T_k^{k\in[1,n]}(T_k\prec\/S_j)$. All pairs of
types $S_k,S_l\in\{S_j^{j\in[1,m]}\}$ with $k\not=l$ are
\emph{incomparable}, i.e.,
$S_1\not\sim\/S_2\equiv\/S_1\not\preceq\/S_2\land\/S_1\not\succeq\/S_2$.
The logical rule for the operation MIN is as follows.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:min}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\/V:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad\/S\in\/\{T_k^{k\in[1,n]}\}\quad\forall\/i\in[1,n],\ S\preceq\/T_i\lor\/S\not\sim\/T_i}
      {V:_{\Darr}S}
\end{equation}

The rule says that $S$ is a minimal type of a ground type
$\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$. $S$ is minimal since all other $T_i$ types are
either more general or equal ($\succeq$), or not related to $S$. The
rule generates all MIN types of $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$.

The following rule is used for gathering all MIN types of
$\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$. The result is a conjunction of minimal types
$\land[S_1..S_m]$.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:min-gather}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\forall\/i\in[1,m],\ V:_\Darr\/S_i}
      {V:_{\Darr}\land[S_j^{j\in[1,m]}]}
\end{equation}


The rule for filtering $\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ of all
$T_i\succeq\/T_j$ where $i\not=j$ by using algorithmic typing is
defined as follows. The algorithm implementing the operation MIN is
presented in Section \ref{sec:alg-MIN}.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:alg-min}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\vdasharr\/V:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad\vdasharr\/\{S_j^{j\in[1,m}\}=\,\Darr\kern -3pt[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
{\vdasharr\/V:_{\Darr}\land\/[S_j^{j\in[1,m]}]}
\end{equation}

Now we have a minimal ground type of a value $V$ in the form of a
conjunction of minimal types $S_i$ of $V$. The types that are
important from the perspective of typing computer languages defined on
values from a KG are the user-defined types of triples. The definition
of a user-defined triple type requires the knowledge about the meaning
of the binary relationship defined by a predicate---this is reflected
in the selection of the domain and range of the predicate.

The first step in verifying the relations between the ground and
user-defined types of a value $V$ is the computation of a join type
from a ground type of $V$. The join type of a ground type should be a
subtype of the user-defined types that describe the value $V$. If the
join type is not a subtype of the user-defined type then there is an
error in stored types of a value $V$.

Let us now present the typing rules that, given $V\in\upsilon$,
determine the join of $\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$ as
$V:\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$. Recall from Section
\ref{sec:join-meet-types} that we defined the operation join as the
minimal upper bounds of a set $\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}$. Let
$P=(\tau,\preceq)$ and $\{T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\}\subseteq\/P$. A join
$\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ is a set of minimal upper bounds
$\{S_j^{j\in[1,m]}\}$ that are related to all types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$
via $\preceq$, and are minimal.

%\nnotes{$\llb\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\rrb\subseteq\bigcup_{i\in[1..n]}\llb\/T_i\rrb\subseteq\llb\/T\rrb$.}
%\ennotes{A join type is used when we want to determine the user-defined type of $V$.}

Rules \ref{rul:join-logic}-\ref{rul:join-gather} present the logical
definition of the join type. The following Rule \ref{rul:join-logic}
determines one join type but can be used to generate all join types.


\begin{equation}
\label{rul:join-logic}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon,\, \/V:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad\/S\in\tau,\, T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\preceq\/S\quad\forall\/P\in\tau,\, (T_i^{i\in[1,n]}\preceq\/P\land\/S\preceq\/P)\lor\/P\not\sim\/S}
      {V:_\sqcup\/S}
\end{equation}

The individual join types derived by the above rule are gathered
into one $\land$ type of join types by using the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:join-gather}
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\/S_i^{i\in[1,m]}\in\tau\quad\forall\/i\in[1,m],\ V:_\sqcup\/S_i}
{V:_{\sqcup}\land[S_i^{i\in[1,m]}]}
\end{equation}

The following Rule \ref{rul:join-alg} derives the complete join type
in one step. The operator join $\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ returns as a
result a set of minimal upper bound types of $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$. Since
all the join types are valid types of $V$, we can group them into one
$\land$ type.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:join-alg} 
\dfrac{V\in\upsilon\quad\vdasharr\/V:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad\/\vdasharr\{S_j^{j\in[1,m]}\}=\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
      {\vdasharr\/V:_\sqcup\land[S_j^{j\in[1,m]}]}
\end{equation}

The join types are used as the starting point for searching the
correct user-defined type. In the case the predicate of has two
different definitions in two different contextes, then the paths from
join types to the domain and range classes would determine the
definition of the triple type. The details are presented in Section
\ref{sec:stored-3types}.

\subsection{Ground types of a triple\label{sec:3-ground-types}}

%
% deriving ground types of triples
% taking MIN types of ground types
% determine join type of minimal ground types
% 

\noindent
The ground types of a triple $t$ are either a stored ground type, a
minimal ground type, or a join type (least upper bound). The stored
ground type includes types that are stored in a KG. The minimal ground
type then consists of solely the minimal gound types. Finally, the
join type is a least upper bound type of the minimal ground type.

A ground type of an individual identifier $I$ is a class $C$ related
to $I$ by one-step type relationship $:_\darr$ denoting a ground type,
as presented by Rule \ref{rul:ident-1step-type}. In terms of the
concepts of a knowledge graph, $C$ and $I$ are related by the
relationship rdf:type.

A ground type of a triple $t=(I_s,p,I_o)$ is a product type
$T_s*p*T_o$ that includes the ground types of $t$'s components $I_s$
and $I_o$, and the property $p$ which now has the role of a type. A
ground type of a triple is defined by the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-ground}
\dfrac{t\in\/\T_i,\ t=(I_s,p,I_o)\quad I_s:_\darr\/T_s\quad I_o:_\darr\/T_o\quad p:_\darr\text{rdf:Property}}
      {t:_\darr\/T_s*p*T_o}
\end{equation}

The type $T_s$ is either a class identifier or a $\land$-type composed
of a conjunction of minimal set of class identifiers. The predicates
are treated differently to the subject and object components of
triples. The predicates have the role of classes while they are
instances of rdf:Property.

A triple can have multiple ground types. They may be gathered
into a single $\land$-type by using the following rule. The types
$T_1$,\ldots,$T_n$ are obtained using Rule~\ref{rul:3-ground}.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-ground-gather}
\dfrac{\forall\/i\in[1..n],\ t:_\darr\/T_i}
      {t:_\darr\land[T_i]}
\end{equation}


\notes{Typing using lub types of $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$. Explain why this is needed?}

Let us now define the least upper bound types (abbr. \emph{lub}) of
ground types derived by Rule \ref{rul:3-ground-gather}. Since a
partialy ordered set is not a lattice, we can have more than one lub
type for a given set of ground types.

The lub types of a given list of triple types $T_i^{i\in[1,n]}$ are
computed in two steps as before when gathering multiple ground types
with conjunction. A single lub type is defined as follows.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad T\in\T_t,\quad \forall\/i,\ T_i\preceq\/T\quad \forall\/S\in\T_t,\ \forall\/i,\ (T_i\preceq\/S\land\/T\preceq\/S)\lor\/T\not\sim\/S}
      {t:_\sqcup\/T}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad \vdasharr\/T=\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
      {t:_{\darr\sqcup}\/T}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t:_\darr\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]\quad \vdasharr\forall\/i\in[1..m],\ S_i=\sqcup[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
      {t:_{\darr\sqcup}\land[S_1..S_m]}
\end{equation}

The above rule states that a type $T$ is a lub type of a ground type 
$\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ if all ground types $T_i$ are subtypes of
$T$. Furthermore, the lub type $T$ is the least (closest) supertype of
all members of ground $\land$-type $T_1,\ldots\/,T_n$. The lub types
can be now gathered using the following rule.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\forall i\in[1..n](t:_\sqcup\/T_i)}
      {t:_\sqcup\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]}
\end{equation}


\memo{The types of $s$ and $o$ can be any classes $T_s$ and $T_o$ from
  ${\cal I}_c$, while the type of $p$ has to be a class $T_p$ that is
  a subclass of rdf:Property. The typing of a triple $t$ is correct
  since the interpretation of $T$ includes $t$.}

\memo{Moreover, the types $T$ that are derived by the above rule are
  minimal in the sense that given the information provided, i.e., the
  types of $t$'s components, their interpretations are minimal
  possible comparing them to the interpretations of all other derived
  types of $t$.}






\subsection{Stored types of triples\label{sec:stored-3types}}

\notes{Computing the minimal and valid stored type of a triple $t=(s,p,o)\in\T_i$.}
\nnotes{Stored types are defined by linking a predicate $p$ to a domain and range classes.}
\nnotes{Only types (domains and ranges) defined for $p'\succeq\/p$ are valid stored types.}
\nnotes{There are no other valid types below, i.e., for $p'\prec\/p$.}
\nnotes{Among the valid stored types the most specific and unrelated stored types are selected.}
\nnotes{In other words, only glb types of valid stored types are selected.}
\nnotes{Finally, the minimal and complete type of $t$ is an $\lor$-type including all previously selected glb types.}

We first find stored triple types for a given triple $t=(s,p,o)$. A
stored type is constructed by selecting types including a predicates
$p'\succeq\/p$ as the domains and ranges.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-stored}
\dfrac{t\in\T_i,\, t=(s,p,o)\quad p'\in\I_p, p\preceq\/p'\quad (p',\text{domain},T_s)\in\/g\quad (p',\text{range},T_o)\in\/g}
      {t:_\uarr\/T_s*p*T_o}
\end{equation}

The domain and range of a predicate $p$ can be defined for any
super-predicate, they do not need to be defined particulary for
$p$. In addition, the domain and range of a predicates do not need to
be defined for the same predicate; they can be defined for any of the
super-predicates separately. The following rule captures also the last
statement.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-stored1}
\dfrac{t\in\Ti, t=(s,p,o)\quad p_1,p_2\in\I_p\quad p\preceq\/p_1\quad p\preceq\/p_2\quad (p_1,\text{domain},T_s)\in\/g
                \quad (p_2,\text{range},T_o)\in\/g}
      {t:_\uarr\/T_s*p*T_o}
\end{equation}

\notes{If $p$ inherits from multiple $p'\succeq\/p$, then the above rule generates multiple types. Explain.}
\nnotes{The type is determined only if the domain and range of $p'\succeq\/p$ is defined.}
\nnotes{Otherwise, the domain and range shoud be $\top$. This should be included.}

The following rule is a judgment for a (user-defined) type of a
concrete triple $t=(s,p,o)$. A user-defined type of $t$ is the
greatest lower bound (abbr. glb) of stored types generated by the rule
\ref{rul:3-stored}.

\medskip
\notes{Valid stored types of $t$: the smallest valid types of all stored types for $p$.}
\nnotes{Justification: smallest interpretation - smallest search space for queries.}
\nnotes{Valid stored types are solely those defined "above" $p$.}
\nnotes{The MIN types of valid stored types "above" $p$ are selected!}
\nnotes{The rule generates one MIN type by one.}
\nnotes{These (MIN types) are collected in a $\lor$-type including all MIN types.}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{t\in\T_i\quad T\in\T_t,\, t:_\uarr\/T\quad \forall\/S\in\T_t,\, t:_\uarr\/S\quad T\preceq\/S\lor\/T\not\sim\/S}
      {t:_{\Darr}\/T}
\end{equation}

The first premise says that $t$ is a ground triple. The second premise
enumerates stored types $T$ of $t$. The third premise requires that
$T$ is the most specific type of all possible types $S$ of $t$. In
other words, there is no type $S$ of $t$ that is a subtype of
$T$. Hence, $T$ is the MIN type of the stored types of $t$.

\notes{What is the meaning of triple types that are \emph{not related} ($\not\sim$).}
\nnotes{1. This can be either that we have two $p$ roots with unrelated MIN triple types.}
\nnotes{This is possible only if $p$ is defined for semantically different concepts.}
\nnotes{2. Two $p$-rooted but unrelated stored types through multiple inheritance.}
\nnotes{Therefore, we can have more than one stored MIN types.}

The implementation view of the above rule is as follows. The schema
triples are obtained from the inherited values of the predicates
rdfs:domain and rdfs:range. The inherited values have to be the
closest when traveling from property $p$ towards the more general
properties.

The MIN types are now gathered in a $\lor$-type. Hence, the resulting
$\lor$-type includes all MIN types of $t$.

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\forall\/T_i\in\T_t,\, t:_\Darr\/T_i}
      {t:_\Darr\lor[T_i]}
\end{equation}

The premise says that we identify all triple types $T_i$ that are the
MIN types $t:_\Darr\/T_i$. The MIN types are gathered in a triple type
$\lor[T_i]$.





\subsection{Typing a triple}

\notes{Why using $\land$ and $\sqcap$ types for typing a triple $t$?}
\nnotes{We would like to check typing of a triple $t\in\T_i$.}
\nnotes{We compute first the ground type $T_g=\land[T_i^{i\in[1,n]}]$ and a stored type $T_s$ of $t$.}
\nnotes{The ground type $T_g$ is computed from the ground types of $t$'s components.}
\nnotes{The subtype relation should hold $T_g\preceq\/T_s$.}

\notes{Two ways of defining semantics.}
\notes{1) enumeration style: stored types are enumerated as alternatives ($\lor$).}
\notes{2) packed together: alternative types are packed in one $\bigvee$ type.}
\notes{One advantage of (1) is that individual glb types can be processed further individually.}
\notes{Advantage of (2) is the higer-level semantics without going in implementation.}

\notes{Stored types have to be related to all join ground types to represent the correct type of a triple.}
\notes{It seems it would be easier to check the pairs one-by-one using (1) in algorithms.}
\notes{In case of using complete types in the phases, types would further have to be processed by $\land,\lor$ rules.}

The type of a triple $t=(s,p,o)$ is computed by first deriving the
base type $T$ and the top type $S$ of $t$. Then, we check if $S$ is
reachable from $T$ through the sub-class and sub-property hierarchies,
i.e., $T\preceq\/S$.

\begin{equation}
\label{rul:3-typing}
\dfrac{t\in\T_i\quad T\in\T_t,\, t:_{\darr}T\quad S\in\T_t,\, t:_\uarr\/S\quad T\preceq\/S}
      {t:S}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Computing MIN type\label{sec:alg-MIN}}


\notes{We have a tuple $t=(s,p,o)$.}
\nnotes{The task is to compute MIN type of $t$'s stored types.}
\nnotes{The algorithm is using the predicates $p'\preceq\/p$ to obtain all domains and ranges of $p$.}



\notes{FUNCTION typeGlbStored ($p$: Property, $cnt$: Integer, $d_p$,$r_p$: Set): Type}
\notes{BEGIN}
\notes{if $d_p=\{\}$ then $d_p =  \{ c_s \mid (p,\text{rdfs:domain},c_s)\in\/G\}$}
\notes{if $r_p=\{\}$ then $r_p =  \{ c_o \mid (p,\text{rdfs:range},c_o)\in\/G\}$}

\notes{$T_{p'} = typeGlbStored(p',cnt+1$,$d_p$,$r_p$)}
\notes{$ts = ts\cup\/\{T_{p'}\}$}
\notes{END}
\notes{RETURN $\lor\/ts$}
\notes{END}




\notes{Start with a set $\{p\}$ and close the set by using rdfs:superPropertyOf marking them with the ``distance'' from $p$.}
\nnotes{Gather all domain and range types of $p'\preceq\/p$ in $d_p$ and $r_p$, respectively, marking each domain and range class with the distance of the related $p'$.}
\nnotes{Generate types $\lor(s_t,p,o_t)$ where $s_t\in\/d_p$, $o_t\in\/r_p$ and both $s_t$ and $o_t$ are marked with the minimal values.}
\nnotes{Note that there can be more than one element $s_t$ (and $o_t$) marked with a minimal value in $d_p$ (and $r_p$). Hence Cartesian product of the selected domains and ranges are used to generate types $(s_t,p,o_t)$. }






\subsection{Computing join type\label{sec:alg-join}}

\notes{A ground type of a triple $t=(s,p,o)$ is a type $(s_t,p,o_t)$ such that $(s,\text{rdf:type},s_t)$ and $(o,\text{rdf:type},o_t)$.}
\notes{The sets of types $s_t$ and $o_t$ are stored in the sets $g_s$ and $g_o$, respectively.}
\notes{The ground type of $t$ is then $T_t=(\land\/g_s,p,\land\/g_o)$.}
\notes{The lub of a type $T_t$ is computed as follows.}

\notes{For each $s_t\in\/g_s$ ($o_t\in\/g_o$) compute a closure of a set $\{s_t\}$ ($\{o_t\}$) with respect to the relationship rdfs:superClassOf obtaining the sets $c_s$ and $c_o$.}
\notes{Each step of the closure newly obtained classes are marked with the number of steps if new in the set, and the maximum of both numbers of steps otherwise.}
\notes{The maximum guaranties the monotonicity: $s_t\prec_\darr\/s_t'\Rightarrow\/m(s_t)>m(s_t')$.}
\notes{Proof: Assume $m(s_t)<=m(s_t')$. Since $s_t\prec_\darr\/s_t'$ then $m(s_t')+1$ is maximum of $s_t$. Contradiction.}

\notes{The lub of $T_t$ is computed by intersecting all sets $c_s$ ($c_o$) obtained for each $s_t$ ($o_t$), yielding a lub type of $g_s$ ($g_o$).}
\notes{The intersection of sets is computed step-by-step. Initially, intersection is the first set $c_s$ ($c_o$) of some $s_t$ ($o_t$).}
\notes{In each step, a new set $c_s$ ($c_o$) for another $s_t$ ($o_t$) is intersected with previous result.}
\notes{The classes that are in the result (intersection) are merged by selecting the maximum number of closure steps for each class in the intersection.}
\notes{The reason for this is to obtain the number of steps within which all ground classes reach a given lub class.}

\notes{Finally, the lub classes are selected from the resulted intersection of all $c_s$ ($c_o$).}
\notes{The class with the smallest number of steps is taken. Then, it is deleted from the set together with all its super-classes.}
\notes{If set is not empty the previous step is repeated.}
