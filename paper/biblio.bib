After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},

abstract="With the development of the Semantic Web, an increasingly large number of organizations represent their data in RDF format. A single machine cannot efficiently process complex queries on RDF graphs. It becomes necessary to use a distributed cluster to store and process large-scale RDF datasets that are required to be partitioned. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware partitioning method for RDF graphs. Inspired by the PageRank algorithm, classes in the RDF schema graphs are ranked. A novel partitioning algorithm is proposed, which leverages the semantic information of RDF and reduces crossing edges between different fragments. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our semantic-aware RDF graph partitioning outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

                  very large quantities of Resource Description
                  Framework (RDF) data. It presents an evaluation of
                  an initial prototype, showing that Clustered TDB
                  offers excellent scaling characteristics with
                  respect to load times and query throughput. Design
                  decisions are justified in the context of a
                  literature review on Database Management System
                  (DBMS) and RDF store clustering, and it is shown
                  that many techniques created during the course of
                  DBMS research are applicable to the problem of
                  storing RDF data. }

In particular, we study distributed indexing methods for graph-structured data and parallel query evaluation methods on a cluster of computers. We evaluate the system on a dataset with 430 million statements collected from the Web, and provide scale-up experiments on 7 billion synthetically generated statements.",

                  number of organizations committing to use its core
                  principles for exposing and interlinking data sets
                  for seamless exchange, integration, and reuse. More
                  and more ICT ventures offer innovative data
                  management services on top of Linked (Open) Data,
                  creating a demand for data practitioners possessing
                  skills and detailed knowledge in this area. Ensuring
                  the availability of such expertise will prove
                  crucial if businesses are to reap the full benefits
                  of these advanced data management technologies, and
                  the know-how accumulated over the past years by
                  researchers, technology enthusiasts and early
                  adopters.  This book aims at facilitating
                  professional training for data practitioners that
                  want to use Linked Data in their daily work. Each
                  chapter of this book is targeting a different
                  crucial task related to Linked Data. You will have
                  the opportunity to study in depth various aspects of
                  the usage of Linked Data, watch webinar movies and

	systems containing from a few hundred to more than a thousand patterns
	and objects. This article presents the algorithm in detail. It explains
	the basic concepts of the algorithm, it describes pattern and object
	representations that are appropriate for the algorithm, and it describes
