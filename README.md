# Type-checking Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs are based on a knowledge representation language,
including some modeling constructs that are not common to programming
languages. This makes type-checking of the knowledge graphs a
challenge. In addition, the schema level of the knowledge graphs, as
well as the higher meta-levels are not only rich in the expressive
power of modeling but also in the quantity of data that represents the
meta-levels of the knowledge graph. For example, the Yago4 knowledge
graph includes around a half of million classes.
