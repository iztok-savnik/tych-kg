# Type-checking Knowledge Graphs

We first present a formal view of a knowledge graph. On this basis, the
type-checking rules are developed to define correct typing relationships among
the triples of a knowledge graph. We discuss the algorithms for verifying the
typing relationships against the given knowledge graph. Finally, we present the
experimental results of type-checking the Yago4 knowledge graph.
